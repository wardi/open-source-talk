Source code as liability
------------------------

* Share maintenance and testing burden
* Get external contributions


Stay current

* follow the contribution guidelines
* update documentation
* include unit tests

* encourage outside contributions


Winning at OSS

* opportunity for outside contributions
* stay up to date with upstream


Becoming an OSS-friendly organization
-------------------------------------

* do more than just follow the licenses
* get permission to work in the open

* issue tracking and workflow
* continuous integration


Use IRC internally
------------------

* unplug the telephones
* close the doors/headphones stay on
* technical, management, marketing, everyone


Look for OSS feature opportunities
----------------------------------

* break your code into reusable features
* separate internal business logic
* develop in the open and in collaboration with project developers


Final notes
-----------

* Goal: get your code upstream
* Individual developers involved with your OSS community
* Offer your fixes and features back as OSS
* Adopt an OSS-friendly culture in your organization
