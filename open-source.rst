Overview
--------

* Goals when working with OSS
* Profile of OSS communities and developers
* Contributing to OSS
* Becoming an OSS-friendly organization


Getting the most from OSS
-------------------------

* Freedom to build on source code
* Minimize lifetime cost of your project
* Better, smaller, more maintainable code


Source code as liability
------------------------

* Share maintenance and testing burden
* Get external contributions


Stay current
------------

* Track latest development of upstream project
* Know when something breaks immediately
* Help shape the newest features


Goals
-----

* Less code
* More features
* Costs controlled


Why people contribute to OSS
----------------------------

Elena Williams' talk:

http://pyvideo.org/video/2646/hitchhikers-guide-to-participating-in-open-source

* Autonomy: my way
* Mastery: pursue perfection
* Purpose: scratch an itch


Why people contribute to OSS
----------------------------

* learn by building
* exposure for author or project
* proof of capability for employers
* moral reasons
* paid to do it
* fun


OSS communities
---------------

* work with self-motivated, smart, creative people
* sense of connection/recognition
* chaotic
* anarchic

OSS projects
------------

* how large?
* new?
* well established?
* dead?
* how is it structured?
* roles?


Accepting criticism in public
-----------------------------

* a learned skill
* be overly humble in communication
* keep ego in check
* use a personal email address
* accept mistakes, move on


Benefits of IRC
---------------

* speak with project developers and other users
* find out what other people are having trouble with
* learn the culture
* interruption-free
* international
* answer questions and you're part of the community


Using IRC
---------

* RULE 1: ask your actual question
* RULE 2: don't leave


Reporting issues
----------------

* include your IRC conversation
* provide code that fails
* explain everything you tried
* make it look nice


Writing a patch
---------------

* start small
* discuss your approach on IRC
* use the developers' tools
* follow the contribution guidelines
* update documentation
* include unit tests
* be prepared to throw it out and rewrite it


Adding a feature
----------------

* document your approach
* make it look nice
* get buy-in from project developers
* code, test, document, polish, repeat
* work with project developers throughout


After your feature is accepted
------------------------------

* promote it
* support it
* fix problems reported quickly
* package and manage releases if applicable
* encourage outside contributions


Winning at OSS
--------------

* up-front work
* users to support
* releases to manage
* better code
* opportunity for outside contributions
* stay up to date with upstream


Becoming an OSS-friendly organization
-------------------------------------

* do more than just follow the licenses
* get permission to work in the open


Use OSS development tools
-------------------------

* version control system
* issue tracking and work flow
* continuous integration


Use IRC internally
------------------

* unplug the telephones
* close the doors/headphones stay on
* technical, management, marketing, everyone


Look for OSS feature opportunities
----------------------------------

* break your code into reusable features
* separate internal business logic
* develop in the open and in collaboration with project developers


Final notes
-----------

* Goals: less code, more features, costs controlled
* Individual developers involved with your OSS community
* Develop your fixes and features as OSS
* Adopt an OSS-friendly culture in your organization


Thank you!
